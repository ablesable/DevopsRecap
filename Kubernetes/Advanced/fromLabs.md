To see the pods running on a specific node in a Kubernetes cluster, you can use the `kubectl` command along with the `kubectl get pods` and `kubectl describe node` commands.

Here are the steps:

1. **Get the list of nodes:**
   Run the following command to get the list of nodes in your cluster:

   ```bash
   kubectl get nodes
   ```

   Identify the name of the node you are interested in.

2. **Get the pods on the specific node:**
   Run the following command to get the pods running on a specific node:

   ```bash
   kubectl get pods --field-selector spec.nodeName=NODE_NAME
   ```

   Replace `NODE_NAME` with the name of the specific node you are interested in.

3. **Alternatively, use `kubectl describe`:**
   You can also use `kubectl describe node` to get detailed information about a node, including the list of pods running on it. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   kubectl describe node NODE_NAME
   ```

   Replace `NODE_NAME` with the name of the specific node.

This will provide detailed information about the selected node, including the pods running on it.

Remember that the ability to get information about nodes and pods may depend on your Kubernetes RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) settings. Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to access this information.
