Stateless firewall has no idea about connection and what response or request is inbound or outbound. It has to choose ephemeral port on client really often from wide available range.

Stateless firewalls has to deal with requests and responses seperately (it has to know what allows and what not), but in stateful firewalls, they allows requests and responses automatically.
