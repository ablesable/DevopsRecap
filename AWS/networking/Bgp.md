BGP - Border Gateway Protocol. (Routing protocol).

 BGP exchanges the shortest ASPATH. Even when the table has longer ASPATH. 

 ASPATH is a list of numbers of **Autonomous System Numbers** (ASN) to get to the source. 

 BGP will favourize shortest path, so in case for better, reliable path we can artifically change it in a table.
