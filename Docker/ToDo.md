- After installing a WSL, [here](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/wsl/) are instructions for installing docker for wsl 2 version.
- Docker can use WSL features, so we can use that even from powershell. It doesn't matter if we run this explicitly from wsl linux, or from windows powershell.
- Containers to download:
- - `$ sudo docker pull ubuntu:bionic`
- - `$ sudo docker pull node:12-stretch`
- - `$ sudo docker pull node:12-alpine`
- - `$ sudo docker pull nginx:1.17`
- - `$ sudo docker pull mongo:3`
- - `$ sudo docker pull hugo-builder:0.55` (may require docker login)
