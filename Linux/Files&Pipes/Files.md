## Less and More programs
- less is a program to read files only, newer version of More.
- q key (quitting).
- Less is a program installed by default.

## Man
- This is manual for all sort of programs.
- man uses less, so if you know "less" the more you know :)
- --help/-h is a shorter version of manual. Not the same thing!

## Cat
- This program shows everything in the file.
- Can be used in STDOUT!
- ConCATening to the standard out.

## Tail & Head
- Shows last 10 lines in Tail, and first 10 lines in Head.
- Very good for logs. 
- tail -n 3 (shows only last 3 lines).
- tail -f (for realtime showing) This is good option when we want to focus what is being saved to the file.

## Mkdir
- mkdir -p (Creating a lot of folders e.g hi/my/name/is/bartosz)
