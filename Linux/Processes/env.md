## Env variables

- Variables are shown by typing $ sign before ALL CAPS name of variable.
- in bash session we are allowed to change the name of variables.
- env variables are put in `etc/environment` file.
- changing env variables for single specific user are in ~/.bashrc. After changing it by vi we have to run source command on that file. Because it will run .bashrc file again.
