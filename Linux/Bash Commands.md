- clear (clearing the screen, but I can rewind to what was before)
- ls path-to-directory (list everything inside a directory that we put a path on)
- echo thing-we-want-to-print (just echo something, usefull when we print steps)
- which program-we-re-running (gives us a path to the program we are running right now)
