- pwd (print working directory)
- clear (clearing the screen, but I can rewind to what was before)
- ls path-to-directory (list everything inside a directory that we put a path on)
- echo thing-we-want-to-print (just echo something, usefull when we print steps)
- which program-we-re-running (gives us a path to the program we are running right now)
- touch file (creates a file)
- ls --ignore=directory-we-want-to-ignore (in printing to the console)
- cd ~ (changes directory to home directory of a user e.g. /home/test)
- ctrl + R (opens up a search for a last match in bash history) (Clicking an arrow will leave this pattern in normal console mode again).
- tail specific_file (giving last lines in a specific file)
