- pwd (print working directory)
- clear (clearing the screen, but I can rewind to what was before)
- ls path-to-directory (list everything inside a directory that we put a path on)
- echo thing-we-want-to-print (just echo something, usefull when we print steps)
- which program-we-re-running (gives us a path to the program we are running right now)
- touch file (creates a file)
- ls --ignore=directory-we-want-to-ignore (in printing to the console)
- cd ~ (changes directory to home directory of a user e.g. /home/test)
- ctrl + R (opens up a search for a last match in bash history) (Clicking an arrow will leave this pattern in normal console mode again).
- tail specific_file (giving last lines in a specific file)
- ctrl + shift + c/v (copying and pasting)
- ctrl + k/u (yanking)
- ctrl + c (interrupt program, sigint)
- ctrl + d (sigquit)
- kill (killing process gradually, sends sigterm)
- kill -9 (sigkill, kills process immediately, also their child processes)
- Using ampersand at the end of a command means, that we want to run this program in the background. After hitting enter this will return ID of this process on our console.
