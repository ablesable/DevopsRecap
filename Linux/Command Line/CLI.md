## CLI and basic file system

- Emulator can run a lot of shells. WSL is running Linux and Linux built in emulator is running Bash (the shell).
- Root directory is represented just as slash / 
- A bash command is a program in a terms of REPL env.
- -- help at the end of any bash command will help you what you can do with a command. 
- /home directory have different directories for different users. 
- using names of dictionaries with cd commands without slashes means we're using relative paths.
- Echo command works different for every different shell (e.g. string needs to be put in a quote)
- Argument is a textual information we're passing into the program. 
- -- is a thing called a Flag. Running command with a flag means running a programm in a specific mode!
- -a flag on ls command shows even hidden directories.
- . (dot) in front of a file means it's a hidden file. Just like .gitignore
